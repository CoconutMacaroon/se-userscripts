# SE Userscripts
This repo contains various userscripts I've created for use on Stack Exchange. They're all designed for tampermonkey, but other userscript managers may work. I make these either using Firefox or a Chromium-based browser

## ​[status-*] highlighting for Stack Overflow for Teams
<kbd>[Install](https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/se-userscripts/raw/main/stack-overflow-for-teams-status-tags/stack-overflow-for-teams-status-tags.user.js)</kbd>

This userscript applies highlighting to `[status-*]` tags on Stack Overflow for Teams, as it isn't applied by default.

## Better Paginator
<kbd>[Install](https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/se-userscripts/raw/main/better-paginator/better-paginator.user.js)</kbd>

Better Paginator is a script I created to modify the paginator on the Questions page on SE sites to have a box to enter a specific page number to go to. This userscript was created after [Goku カカロット](https://meta.stackexchange.com/u/1288675) suggested that a feature be added that does this in [this post on MSE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/385699/for-paginated-results-add-a-way-to-type-the-page-number-to-which-to-navigate)
## metasmoke ChatGPT Scanner

metasmoke ChatGPT Scnaner is a userscript that adds a button in metasmoke to scan a post for ChatGPT. This userscript is heavily based on the [OpenAI detector userscript](https://stackapps.com/questions/9611/openai-detector) that [Glorfindel](https://stackapps.com/users/34061/glorfindel) wrote, so tons of credit goes to Glorfindel for this script
