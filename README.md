#SE Userscripts
This repo contains various userscripts I've created for use on Stack Exchange. They're all designed for tampermonkey, but other userscript managers may work. I make these either using Firefox or a Chromium-based browser

## Better Paginator
[<kbd>Install</kbd>](https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/se-userscripts/raw/main/better-paginator/better-paginator.user.js)

Better Paginator is a script I created to modify the paginator on the Questions page on SE sites to have a box to enter a specific page number to go to. This userscript was created after [Goku カカロット](https://meta.stackexchange.com/u/1288675) suggested that a feature be added that does this in [this post on MSE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/385699/for-paginated-results-add-a-way-to-type-the-page-number-to-which-to-navigate)
